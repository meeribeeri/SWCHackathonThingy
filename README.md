Didn't get any exe file or anything due to errors that only appeared on release build not debug, which I couldn't figure out where the issue was.

This is a small program made to take the user's mind off of whatevery their doing, hopefully relieving stress. 
It is also boring enough to not distract the user for long periods of time so they can actually get their work done.
Meant to try and solve the problem of not being able to think of the solution/answer to a problem, and relieve a small amount of stress.
Done by distracting the user for a short while, taking their mind off of what they were having issues with, hopefully relieving them of some stress this way.
It also may make it easier to come up with/find a solution for the problem the user was originally.

This was gonna have more to it, but due to time, and countless errors, this it it.
