Name:Something to use to take your mind off of an issue for a bit

The exe file in there probably won't work. If you want to try and figure it out, go ahead.

This is a small program made to take the user's mind off of whatevery their doing, hopefully relieving stress. 
It is also boring enough to not distract the user for long periods of time so they can actually get their work done.
Meant to try and solve the problem of not being able to think of the solution/answer to a problem, and relieve a small amount of stress.
Done by distracting the user for a short while, taking their mind off of what they were having issues with, hopefully relieving them of some stress this way.
It also may make it easier to come up with/find a solution for the problem the user was originally having/tackling.

This was gonna have more to it, but due to time, and countless errors, this is it.
If you want to try and use this... uh... I don't know how to help that. The errors only appeared while trying to run on release, not debug.
I was too tired to try and fix those errors.

Art was done by me, alongside the code.
Made using C++ and SFML for graphics and such.
